            Wish Week is approaching, and fast! To recap, this is a week-long event where we partner with Make-A-Wish Colorado and their “Kids For Wish Kids” program to sponsor a child with a life-threatening medical condition. As a school, we hold several events throughout the week in order to raise money to grant our Wish Kid’s wish as well as many others.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">**This year, Wish Week is: <b>February 7th - February 11th</b>**</p>
        <ul style="text-align: center;">
            <li>During Wish Week last year, we adopted Rynn into the Mountain Vista family and granted her wish with Spiderman! We granted her wish as well as 25 others! Over the course of 9 years, the Mountain Vista community has granted over 100+ wishes and raised over a million dollars! Resulting in the number one fundraising school in the nation for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li>Wish Week 2022 is also going to be a very special year. This year, our Wish Kid is named Walter and his wish is to have a space experience and go to space camp. Make sure you keep a close eye on February 11th to see an out-of-this-world experience.</li>
            <li>Walter is 9 years old and has Cystic Fibrosis, which is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Walter loves space and spends his time researching planets, stars, and solar systems. He likes to listen to classical music, play chess, and watch Star Wars and Odd Squad in his free time. His favorite color is sky blue and his favorite foods are Raisin Bran Cereal, chocolate ice cream, and french fries.</li>
            <li>We will be partnering with Be A Good Person for the ninth year. Each year they create a custom design for our Wish Kid.</li>

This is to encourage involvement and participation. Students are encouraged to purchase wristbands as it is the easiest and cheapest way to participate in all Wish Week festivities!

If you do not have a wristband (adults/spectators included) there is a $5 entry fee to each event.</li>
